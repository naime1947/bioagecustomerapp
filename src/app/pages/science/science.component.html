      <h2>How BioAge works</h2>
      <h3>
        BioAge determines a personâ€™s biological age, which can give an
        indication of their overall health, by looking at vascular, metabolic,
        inflammatory and lifestyle indicators present in the retinal image.
      </h3>
      <p>
        BioAge uses non-invasive retinal images, taken during a routine eye
        exam. The AI engine powering BioAge has learned from over 1.3 million
        retinal images.

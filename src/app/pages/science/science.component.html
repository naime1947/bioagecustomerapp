      <h2>How BioAge works</h2>
      <h3>
        BioAge determines a person’s biological age, which can give an
        indication of their overall health, by looking at vascular, metabolic,
        inflammatory and lifestyle indicators present in the retinal image.
      </h3>
      <p>
        BioAge uses non-invasive retinal images, taken during a routine eye
        exam. The AI engine powering BioAge has learned from over 1.3 million
        retinal images.

    <h2>Why is knowing a person’s “biological age” important?</h2>
    <h3>
      Not all people age at the same rate(1) and as a result there is increasing
      interest in delineating between an individual’s chronological age and
      their biological age.
    </h3>

    <p>
      While chronological age is defined as the number of years a person has
      lived, biological age refers to how well the cells in a person’s body are
      ageing and functioning<sup>(2)</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biological age, therefore, provides a better indicator of life span and
      future functional capacity<sup>(3-6)</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although differing theories exist to explain this process, it is
      recognised that the speed at which the cells deteriorate depends broadly
      upon factors such as the genes we inherit, our lifestyle choices, how much
      stress we are under and how our bodies respond to infections we get.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work in this area has already revealed that estimates of biological age
      can more accurately predict mortality or the onset of a broad spectrum of
      physical and psychological diseases ranging from cardiovascular disease
      (CVD)<sup>(7)</sup> to clinically significant depression<sup>(8)</sup> than
      chronological age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until now, most of the tools used to assess biological age require the
      collection of data which link an individual’s demographic/social status
      with blood tests and/or radiological tests<sup>(9)</sup>.
